## What is WAYD?

WAYD is a skill that lets programmers share short status updates ("vibes") with strangers in the AI-coding-agents community, while compilations run, tests crawl, or `npm install` does its eternal thing. Open it with `/wayd`, post a 1000-character vibe under your real GitHub handle, scroll a random feed of other people's vibes, react with emojis, reply via comments, and get back to work.

Behind the scenes WAYD uses GitHub Issues for storage, but **you'll never see it**. No issue numbers, no JSON, no `gh` commands in your terminal. Just posts and people.

### Why does this exist?

Because programming alone in front of an AI agent is a weirdly lonely experience, and "what are you doing right now?" is a question that connects strangers faster than any feature request ever could. WAYD is for the 4-minute stretch where you're staring at a failing test and want to know that someone, somewhere, is also losing their mind over a `Promise<Promise<Array<any>>>`.

---

## How it works

You install the skill into your AI coding agent. From then on:

```
You:   /wayd
WAYD:  👋 Welcome back. You have 2 new replies on a post.
       What now? [s]croll · [i]nbox · [p]ost · [q]uit

You:   s

WAYD:  ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
       🤡 cursed-code · @alex · 2h ago
       ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

       Looking at a doStuff() method that's 800 lines long,
       written by me 6 months ago. Who is that idiot?

       ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
       😂 12   ❤️ 4   🚀 1                💬 7 replies
       ━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

       What now? [n]ext  [😂❤️🤯😭🚀👀]  [c]omment  [t]hread  [q]uit

You:   😂

WAYD:  ✓ Reacted. Next vibe:
       ...
```

That's the whole loop: post → scroll → react/reply → repeat.

## The 8 vibes

| Vibe | Captures | Example |
|------|----------|---------|
| 🤡 **cursed-code** | "this code is an abomination" | *"My colleague wrote a 800-line method called `doStuff()`. Today I inherit it."* |
| 🪦 **rip-me** | "something died, possibly me" | *"`git push --force` on main at 23:47, please send help"* |
| 🫠 **brain-melt** | "my brain is leaking" | *"I've stared at 3 files for 10 minutes and I don't remember what language this is"* |
| 🧙 **dark-arts** | "I solved it with evil" | *"Bug fixed with `setTimeout(fn, 100)`. Don't ask. Don't touch. It works."* |
| 🔥 **hot-take** | "opinion that will start a war" | *"If you use spaces instead of tabs you are a terrible person and you should question yourself"* |
| 💭 **shower-thought** | "random thought" | *"We don't create bugs. We reveal them. They already exist in the universe: we just interpret them."* |
| 🤔 **existential** | "is this the life I wanted?" | *"I pay my mortgage by moving JSON from one endpoint to another. Is this what my grandfather imagined for me?"* |
| ☕ **procrastinating** | "I should be working" | *"14 tickets in backlog. Reading WAYD instead. Send help. No actually send another post."* |

You pick one when you compose. It shows on your post and lets others filter the scroll by mood.

## Installation

### Claude Code Plugin *(recommended)*

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ferdinandobons/wayd
claude plugin install wayd@wayd
```

### CLI Install *(universal)*

```bash
npx skills add ferdinandobons/wayd
```

### Clone & Copy

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ferdinandobons/wayd.git
cp -r wayd/wayd ~/.claude/skills/
```

### Git Submodule

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/ferdinandobons/wayd.git .agents/wayd
```

### SkillKit *(Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot)*

```bash
npx skillkit install ferdinandobons/wayd
```

### Claude.ai

Download the latest `.skill` file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ferdinandobons/wayd/releases) and upload it in **Settings → Skills**.

---

## Updating

**Claude Code Plugin:**
```bash
claude plugin update wayd@wayd
```

> If the update doesn't pick up new changes, refresh the marketplace source and reinstall:
> ```bash
> claude plugin uninstall wayd@wayd
> claude plugin marketplace remove wayd
> claude plugin marketplace add ferdinandobons/wayd
> claude plugin install wayd@wayd
> ```

**CLI / SkillKit:** re-run the install command: it overwrites the previous version.

**Git Submodule:**
```bash
git submodule update --remote .agents/wayd
```

**Claude.ai:** Download the latest `.skill` file from the [Releases page](https://github.com/ferdinandobons/wayd/releases) and re-upload in **Settings → Skills**.

## First-time setup

The first time you invoke WAYD it'll walk you through a 30-second setup:

1. **Check `gh` CLI is installed and authenticated.** If not, you'll get clear copy-pasteable instructions.
2. **Cache your GitHub handle** locally so WAYD knows who you are.
3. **Accept the [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md)** (one time, ever).
4. **Optionally add `gh` to your Bash allowlist** so you don't get prompted before every action.

Then you're in. No tokens, no signup, no email confirmations.

---

## Commands

You can use slash commands or natural language, WAYD understands both.

| What you want to do | Try saying |
|--------------------|------------|
| Open WAYD | `/wayd`, "open wayd" |
| Post a vibe | `/wayd post`, "I want to post a rant" |
| Scroll the feed | `/wayd scroll`, "let me scroll" |
| Filter by vibe | `/wayd scroll cursed-code`, "show me hot takes" |
| Check your replies | `/wayd inbox`, "any new replies?" |
| Delete a post (your own) | `/wayd delete` (while it's visible) |
| Block someone | `/wayd block @user` |
| Unblock someone | `/wayd unblock @user` |
| Get help | `/wayd help`, "what can I do?" |
| Quit | `q`, "bye" |

While scrolling, you can `n` (next), tap an emoji to react, `c: <text>` to comment, `t` to open the thread, or `q` to quit.

## Privacy & data

- **Identity**: WAYD uses your real GitHub username. It's the same handle that appears on issues and comments: there's no separate WAYD account.
- **Local state**: WAYD stores small files in `~/.claude/skills/wayd/data/` (your GitHub username, your block list, scroll history, last-check timestamps). Never committed, never sent anywhere.
- **What's public**: every post and comment you make is a public GitHub issue/comment on this repo. Treat WAYD as a public square: assume your boss could read it.
- **Deletion**: `/wayd delete` marks your post as `[deleted by author]` and locks the thread. The issue itself remains on GitHub (we can't truly delete it as a non-admin user) but it disappears from WAYD's scroll.

---

## Code of Conduct

WAYD has a [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). The short version: no harassment, no NSFW, no spam, be a decent human. Violations get you banned from the repo, which means you can't post or comment anymore.

---

## Contributing

WAYD is an experiment. If you have ideas for new vibes, UX improvements, or features that fit the "coffee break" spirit, open an issue with the `feature-request` label (not as a WAYD post, those have a different format). PRs welcome.

What WAYD will probably **never** become: a real social network, a feed with karma/streaks/badges, anything with notifications that ping you while you're trying to focus. The whole point is that it lives inside your editor and stays small.

## License

[MIT](LICENSE). Use it, fork it, host your own instance pointed at your own repo, the `repo` key in `wayd/config.yml` is the only thing you need to change.
